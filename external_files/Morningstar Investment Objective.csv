The investment managermayuse derivatives (complex financial instruments), including total return swaps, with the aim of making investment gains in line with the Fund's objective, to reduce risk or to manage the Fund more efficiently. The Fund is actively managed with reference to the Markit iBoxx GBP Non-Gilts all maturities Index, which is broadly representative of the bonds in which it may invest, as this forms the basis of the Fund's performance target. The investment manager has discretion to choose investments for the Fund with weightings different to the index or not in the index. As an additional means of assessing the performance of the Fund, the IA Sterling Corporate Bond sector average, which is based on a peer group of broadly similar funds, may also provide a useful comparator. Strategy The investment manager seeks to provide a total return in excess of that generated by the benchmark over a market cycle by investing primarily in sterling denominated investment grade rated corporate bonds. The investment process combines asset allocation views with rigorous fundamentally driven security selection from the credit analysts. Distribution policy The Fund offers accumulation shares (shares in which net income is retained within the price) and income shares (shares inwhich net income may be paid out to investors). Recommendation This Fund may not be appropriate for investors who plan to withdraw their money within 5 years. The Fund is designed to be used only as one component of several in a diversified investment portfolio. Investors should consider carefully the proportion of their portfolio invested into this Fund. You can buy, sell or switch shares in the Fund on any dealing day and according to certain restrictions, both defined in detail in the Company's Prospectus."

Strategy The investment manager constructs a portfolio around a core of shorter maturity, global investment grade bonds seeking to generate yield above cash, and by applying secular and opportunistic views across countries, currencies and sectors to enhance return and mitigate downside risk. The investment manager will seek to manage the portfolio through the various market environments using a variety of strategies, including (but not limited to) adjusting the overall credit exposure, credit quality, and interest rate duration of the portfolio and the allocation to cash. Transaction costs In addition to the charges set out in the Charges section below, the Fund involves a high level of buying and selling activity and will incur higher portfolio transaction costs which are paid from the assets of the Fund. These may have a material impact on your returns. Distribution policy This share class accumulates income which is retained within the price of the share class. Recommendation This Fund may not be appropriate for investors who plan to withdraw their money within 5 years. The Fund is designed to be used only as one component of several in a diversified investment portfolio. Investors should consider carefully the proportion of their portfolio invested into this Fund. You can buy, sell or switch shares in the Fund on any business day, as defined in the Company's Prospectus.

Risk and reward profile Potentially lower reward Potentially higher reward Lower risk Higher risk 1 2 3 4567 The value of an investment and any income from it can go up or down. When you sell your shares they may be worth less than you paid for them. The rating above is based on the historic volatility of the share class. Historic data may not be a reliable indication of the future risk profile of the Fund. The rating is not guaranteed and may change over time. The share class appears at 3 out of 7. Share classes in higher categories have shown greater and/or more frequent variations in Net Asset Value in the past five years than those in lower categories. The lowest category does not mean risk free. Other material risks not captured by the rating: Credit Risk and High Yield Bonds An issuer of a bond (or money market instrument) may become unable or unwilling to pay interest or repay capital to the Fund. If this happens or the market perceives this may happen, the value of the bond will fall. High yielding (non-investment grade) bonds are more speculative and more sensitive to adverse changes in market conditions. InterestRatesWhen interest rates rise (or fall),the prices of different securities will be affected differently. In particular, bond values generally fall when interest rates rise. This risk is generally greater the longer the maturity of a bond investment. Asset-BackedSecurities The Fund invests in Asset-Backed Securities (ABS) and other forms of securitised investments, which may be subject to greater credit / default, liquidity, interest rate and prepayment and extension risks, compared to other investments such as government or corporate issued bonds and this may negatively impact the realised return on investment in the securities. Prepayment andExtension Some bonds (callable bonds) allow their issuers the right to repay capital early or to extend the maturity. Issuers may exercise these rights when favourable to them and as a result the value of the Fund may be impacted. Emerging Markets Emerging markets expose the Fund to higher volatility and greater risk of loss than developed markets; they are susceptible to adverse political and economic events, and may be less well regulated with less robust custody and settlement procedures. Derivatives and Leverage The Fund may use derivatives towards the aim of achieving its investment objective. This can result in 'leverage', which can magnify an investment outcome and gains or losses to the Fund may be greater than the cost of the derivative. Derivatives also introduce other risks, in particular,that a derivative counterparty may not meet its contractual obligations. ExchangeRates If the Fund holds assets in currencies other than the base currency of the Fund or you invest in a share/unit class of a different currency to the Fund (unless 'hedged'),the value of your investment may be impacted by changes in exchange rates. Currency Hedging When the Fund, or a hedged share/unit class, seeks to mitigate exchange rate movements of a currency relative to the base currency, the hedging strategy itself may create a positive or negative impact to the value of the Fund due to differences in short-term interest rates between the currencies. Liquidity Securities within the Fund could become hard to value or to sell at a desired time and price, especially in extreme market conditions when asset prices may be falling, increasing the risk of investment losses. Counterparty Risk and Operational Risk The Fund could lose money if a counterparty with which the Fund trades becomes unwilling or unable to meet its obligations, or as a result of failure or delay in operational processes or the failure of a third party provider. For more information please see the Company's Prospectus."

Risk and reward profile Potentially lower reward Potentially higher reward Lower risk Higher risk 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 The value of an investment and any income from it can go up or down. When you sell your shares they may be worth less than you paid for them. The rating above is based on the historic volatility of the share class. Historic data may not be a reliable indication of the future risk profile of the Fund. The rating is not guaranteed and may change over time. The share class appears at 4 out of 7. Share classes in higher categories have shown greater and/or more frequent variations in Net Asset Value in the past five years than those in lower categories. The lowest category does not mean risk free. The Fund targets a risk profile of 3 as calculated by Distribution Technology (DT), which is an independent provider of risk profiling. DT profiles funds on a scale of 1-10 and takes into consideration risk targets and other factors as well as past data. This is different to the “Risk andReward Profile” scale above, which is a regulated standard based only on past data. For further information on the DT risk profile please contact us. Other material risks not captured by the rating: CreditRisk An issuer of a bond (or money market instrument) may become unable or unwilling to pay interest or repay capital to the Fund. If this happens or the market perceives this may happen, the value of the bond will fall. InterestRatesWheninterest rates rise (or fall), the prices of different securities will be affected differently. In particular, bond values generally fall when interest rates rise (or are expected to rise). This risk is typically greater the longer the maturity of a bond investment. UnderlyingFunds The Fund invests in other funds (including exchange-traded funds and investment trusts/companies). This may introduce more risky assets, derivative usage and other risks associated with the underlying funds, as well as contributing to a higher level of ongoing charges. Derivatives and Leverage The Fund may use derivatives to help achieve its investment objective. This can result in leverage (higher levels of debt), which can magnify an investment outcome. Gains or losses to the Fund may therefore be greater than the cost of the derivative. Derivatives also introduce other risks, in particular, that a derivative counterparty may not meet its contractual obligations. Exchange Rates If the Fund holds assets in currencies other than the base currency of the Fund, or you invest in a share/unit class of a different currency to the Fund (unless hedged, i.e. mitigated by taking an offsetting position in a related security), the value of your investment may be impacted by changes in exchange rates. Liquidity Securities within the Fund could become hard to value or to sell at a desired time and price, especially in extrememarket conditions when asset prices may be falling, increasing the risk of investment losses. VolatilityParameters The Fund aims to stay within predetermined volatility parameters over a rolling period of at least 5 years. However, the Fund maymove outside these parameters if considered beneficial to investment performance or with the aim of preserving capital. Managing volatility will be prioritised over income generation. Charges to Capital Some or all of the ongoing charges may be taken from capital, which may erode capital or reduce potential for capital growth. Counterparty Risk and Operational Risk The Fund could lose money if a counterparty with which the Fund trades becomes unwilling or unable to meet its obligations, or as a result of failure or delay in operational processes or the failure of a third party provider. For more information please see the Company's Prospectus."

Investment policy The Fund invests at least 80% of its assets in a concentrated portfolio of shares (also known as equities) of companies, of any size, in any industry, in Europe (excluding UK). Companies will be incorporated, headquartered, listed on an exchange in, or deriving significant revenue from, this region.The portfolio may be concentrated in terms of its number of holdings and/or the size of its largest holdings. The Fund may also invest in other assets including cash and money market instruments. The investment manager may use derivatives (complex financial instruments) to reduce risk or to manage the Fund more efficiently. The Fund is actively managed with reference to the FTSEWorld Europe Ex UK Index, which is broadly representative of the companies in which it may invest, as this can provide a useful comparator for assessing the Fund's performance.The investmentmanager has discretion to choose investments for the Fund with weightings different to the index or not in the index. As an additional means of assessing the performance of the Fund, the IA Europe ex UK sector average, which is based on a peer group of broadly similar funds, may also provide a useful comparator. Strategy The investment manager seeks to capture performance by anticipating the catalysts for change in European companies and industries. The investment process blends compelling company-specific stories with sector themes,with a goal of providing access to sustainable long-term growth trends.

The investment manager may use derivatives (complex financial instruments) to reduce risk, to manage the Fund more efficiently, or to generate additional capital or income for the Fund. The Fund is actively managed with reference to the Bloomberg US Aggregate Bond Index, which is broadly representative of the bonds in which it may invest, as this forms the basis of the Fund's performance target. The investment manager has discretion to choose investments for the Fund with weightings different to the index or not in the index, but at times the Fund may hold investments similar to the index. Strategy The investment manager draws on Janus Henderson's integrated fixed income and equity research function, to identify the best risk-adjusted opportunities for the Fund. The strategy has the flexibility to deviate significantly from the index on a sector basis while having a strong focus towards the US. The investment process is dynamic with allocations to different types of bonds determined by the opportunities which exist and is supported by a proprietary research and risk management system. Distribution policy This share class distributes income after the deduction of charges. Distribution frequency Monthly. Recommendation This Fund may not be appropriate for investors who plan to withdraw their money within 5 years. The Fund is designed to be used only as one component of several in a diversified investment portfolio. Investors should consider carefully the proportion of their portfolio invested into this Fund. You can buy, sell or switch shares in the Fund on any business day, as defined in the Company's Prospectus.

The investment manager has a high degree of freedom to choose individual investments for the Fund and to vary allocations between asset types within the constraints of the sector.

The Investment Manager then,within its thematic framework of environmental and social investment themes, seeks to construct a differentiated and well diversified global portfolio, based on the belief that superior returns can be generated by companies that tackle environmental and social challenges and have an impact on the development of a sustainable global economy. These companies should have attractive financial attributes such as persistent revenue growth and durable cash flows,aswell as exhibiting strong management of environmental, social and corporate governance risks. Examples of themes the Investment Manager has identified include efficiency, cleaner energy,water management, environmental services, sustainable transport, sustainable property&finance, safety, quality of life, knowledge & technology and health.

These companies should have attractive financial attributes such as persistent revenue growth and durable cash flows, as well as exhibiting strong management of environmental, social and corporate governance risks. Companies will typically be strategically aligned with themes such as climate change, resource constraints, growing populations, and ageing populations. The Fund avoids investing in fossil fuels and companies that stand to be disrupted by the transition to a low-carbon economy. Other Information The Fund meets the provisions set out in Article 9 of the Sustainable Finance Disclosure Regulation (SFDR) for products that have a sustainable investment objective.

LU2183131247,"Objective The Fund aims to provide capital growth over the long term (5 years or more) by investing in companies whose products and services are considered by the investment manager as contributing to positive environmental or social change andthereby have an impact onthe development of a sustainable global economy. Investment policy The Fund invests at least 80% of its assets in shares (also known as equities) of companies, of any size, in any industry, in any country. The Fund will avoid investing in companies that the investment manager considers to potentially have a negative impact on the development of a sustainable global economy. The Fund may also invest in other assets including cash and money market instruments. The investment manager may use derivatives (complex financial instruments) to reduce risk or to manage the Fund more efficiently.

The investment manager has discretion to choose investments for the Fund with weightings different to the index or not in the index, but at times the Fund may hold investments similar to the index. Strategy The investment manager, within its thematic framework of environmental and social themes and positive/negative (avoidance) criteria screening, seeks to construct a differentiated and well diversified global portfolio of companies, based on the belief that superior returns can be generated by companies that are providing solutions to environmental and social challenges. These companies should have attractive financial attributes such as persistent revenue growth and durable cash flows, as well as exhibiting strong management of environmental, social and corporate governance risks. Companies will typically be strategically aligned with themes such as climate change, resource constraints, growing populations, and ageing populations. The Fund avoids investing in fossil fuels and companies that stand to be disrupted by the transition to a low-carbon economy. Other Information The Fund meets the provisions set out in Article 9 of the Sustainable Finance Disclosure Regulation (SFDR) for products that have a sustainable investment objective. Distribution policy This share class accumulates income which is retained within the price of the share class.

Investment policy The Fund invests at least two-thirds of its assets in a concentrated portfolio of shares (equities) and equity-related securities of smaller companies, in any industry, in Japan. The Fund may also invest in other assets including companies of any size, cash and money market instruments. The investment manager may use derivatives (complex financial instruments) to reduce risk or to manage the Fund more efficiently. The Fund is actively managed with reference to the Russell/Nomura Small Cap Index, which is broadly representative of the companies in which it may invest, as this forms the basis of the Fund's performance target and the level above which performance fees may be charged (if applicable). The investment manager has discretion to choose investments for the Fund with weightings different to the index or not in the index, but at times the Fund may hold investments similar to the index. Strategy The investment manager believes in-depth stock analysis, coupled with superior stock picking are the main drivers of superior long-term performance in Japanese smaller companies. The Fund is designed to capture the undervalued growth potential of Japanese smaller companies by typically investing in the smallest 25% of listed Japanese companies by market capitalisation using a disciplined, pragmatic and risk-aware investment process. The investment approach focuses on stock valuation, investment catalysts and long-term structural growth to drive earnings and returns.

The Fund maintains a well-diversified portfolio of companies which generally fall within the bottom 25% of their relevant market by way of size.

LU0892274704,"Objective The Fund aims to provide a positive (absolute) return, regardless of market conditions, over any 12-month period. A positive return is not guaranteed over this or any other time period and, particularly over the shorter term, the Fund may experience periods of negative returns. Consequently, your capital is at risk. Performance target: To outperform the Euro Short Term Rate (€STR) by at least 1% per annum, after the deduction of charges, over any 3-year period. Investment policy The Fund invests in shares and makes extensive use of derivatives (complex financial instruments) to take both ‘long’ and ‘short’ positions in companies the Investment Manager believes will either rise in value (long positions) or fall in value (short positions) meaning that the Fund may benefit from either scenario. The Fund will hold a significant proportion of its assets in cash and money market instruments as a result of holding derivatives and for when the Investment Manager wishes to take a defensive stance. Conversely, the Fund may also employ ‘leverage’ (so that the Fund can invest a greater amount than its actual value) when the Investment Manager has greater confidence in the opportunities available. Typically, at least two-thirds of the exposure to the long and short positions (in aggregate) will be to companies of any size, in any industry, in Europe (including UK). Companies may be located or do most of their business in this region. The balance of the long and short exposure may be to companies outside this region. The Fund may invest in other assets including bonds (including convertible bonds) and preference shares. The Investment Manager may also use derivatives to reduce risk or to manage the Fund more efficiently. The Fund is actively managed and makes reference to the Euro Short Term Rate (€STR) as this forms the basis of the Fund's performance target and the calculation of performance fees (if applicable). For currency hedged Share Classes, the rate that corresponds with the relevant Share Class currency is used as the basis of the performance comparison and for calculating performance fees. The Investment Manager has complete discretion to choose investments for the Fund and is not constrained by a benchmark. Strategy The Investment Manager targets long-term capital appreciation through exposure primarily to European equities. The manager selects stocks using a fundamental approach, blended with sector themes. The process results in a high-conviction portfolio with a bias towards long positions (where the manager believes the prospects for the companies are positive), complemented by 'short positions' (where prospects are less positive) and other market hedging securities. Other Information The Investment Manager will seek to promote environmental, social, and/or governance (ESG) principles in managing the Fund, which may include the exclusion of issuers that the Investment Manager considers could contribute to significant ESG harm, as further described in the prospectus.

Investment policy The Fund invests at least 80% of its assets in a concentrated portfolio of shares (also known as equities) ofUScompanies, of any size, in any industry. The Fund will avoid investing in companies that the investment manager considers to potentially have a negative impact on the development of a sustainable global economy.

Investment policy The Fund invests at least 80% of its assets in a concentrated portfolio of shares (also known as equities) of US companies, of any size, in any industry. The Fund will avoid investing in companies that the investment manager considers to potentially have a negative impact on the development of a sustainable global economy. The Fund may also invest in other assets including cash and money market instruments. The investment manager may use derivatives (complex financial instruments) to reduce risk or to manage the Fund more efficiently. The Fund is actively managed with reference to the S&P 500 Index, which is broadly representative of the companies in which it may invest, as this can provide a useful comparator for assessing the Fund's performance. The investment manager has discretion to choose investments for the Fund with weightings different to the index or not in the index, but at times the Fund may hold investments similar to the index. Strategy The investment manager, within its thematic framework of environmental and social themes and positive/negative (avoidance) criteria screening, seeks to construct a differentiated and well diversified portfolio of US companies, based on the belief that superior returns can be generated by companies that are providing solutions to environmental and social challenges. These companies should have attractive financial attributes such as persistent revenue growth and durable cash flows, as well as exhibiting strong management of environmental, social and corporate governance risks.

Strategy The investment manager focuses on meetings and calls with company management, along with the use of quantitative filters, to identify potential companies for investment. Emphasis is placed on the robustness of a company’s business model, an analysis of what drives the business, what its competitive advantage is, and the sustainability of returns. The Fund maintains awell-diversified portfolio of companies which generally fall within the bottom 25% of their relevant market by way of size. The liquidity of the company (the degree to which shares can be quickly bought or sold in the market at a price reflecting its intrinsic value) is important in determining whether to invest and the size of the holding for the Fund. in the Company's Prospectus."

Investment Trusts) (the reference index) +0.5% per annum, before the deduction of charges, over any 5 year period. Investment policy The Fund invests at least80%of its assets in shares (also known as equities) of companies, of any size, in any industry, which are included in the reference index. The Fund may also invest in other assets including bonds, Collective Investment Schemes (including those managed by Janus Henderson), cash and money market instruments, and may use derivatives (complex financial instruments), including total return swaps, with the aim ofmaking investment gains in line with the Fund's objective, to reduce risk or to manage the Fund more efficiently. The Fund is in part passively managed as its investments in at least 80% of its assets in shares within the reference index seek to replicate the components of the reference index. The components of the reference index will not be identically replicated and this can lead to differences in performance. Strategy The investment manager seeks to reflect the performance of the reference index while making use of investment strategies aimed at enhancing returns whilst taking a low level of additional risk. Some of the strategies used by the investment manager seek to generate returns based on differences in the prices of securities issued by, or associated with, companies that form part of the reference index. They can include, but are not limited to, liquidity strategies (investing in 'blocks of stock' at discounted prices), and relative value strategies (taking advantage of differences between the prices of securities related to the same company). Other strategies may not be related specifically to the reference index and can be outside the UK to the extent that those strategies remain consistent with the Fund’s Investment Objective and Policy as set out above. Further details explaining the investment strategies are available on the Funds’ pages on ourwebsite (www.janushenderson.com). Distribution policy The Fund offers both accumulation units (units in which net income is retained within the price) and income units (units in which net income is paid out to investors). Recommendation This Fund may not be appropriate for investors who plan to withdraw their money within 5 years. The Fund is designed to be used only as one component of several in a diversified investment portfolio. Investors should consider carefully the proportion of their portfolio invested into this Fund. You can buy, sell or switch units in the Fund on any dealing day and according to certain restrictions, both defined in detail in the Fund's Prospectus.

Strategy TheFundfollows a flexible strategy to construct adiverse portfolio of investments from across the spectrum of fixed income assets. The Investment Manager actively varies the allocation to different types of bonds to suit the prevailing economic environment, based on careful macroeconomic research and credit analysis. At times in the market cycle, the fund will be expected to have higher interest rate sensitivity, which may result in significant underperformance or outperformance, particularly when government bond yieldsmove more quickly or to a greater extent than anticipated. The Investment Manager adopts this approach as it is believed this can be beneficial for long-term performance. OtherInformation TheInvestmentManagerwill seek to promoteenvironmental, social and/or governance (ESG) principles in managing the Fund, which may include the exclusion of issuers that the InvestmentManager considers could contribute to significant ESG harm, as further described in the prospectus.

GB00BN7CMY70,"Objective The Fund aims to provide capital growth over the long term (5 years or more) by investing in technology-related companies that contribute to the development of a sustainable global economy. Investment policy The Fund invests at least90%of its assets in shares (also known as equities) of technology-related companies, of any size, in any country,whose products and services are considered by the Investment Manager as contributing to positive environmental or social change, thereby having an impact on the development of a sustainable global economy. The Fund’s investment universe is defined by technology and technology-related companies that derive at least 50% of their current or future expected revenues from the sustainable technology themes identified by the InvestmentManager. The Fund will avoid investing in companies that the Investment Manager considers could contribute to significant environmental or societal harm. The Fund may also invest in other assets including Collective Investment Schemes (including those managed by Janus Henderson) and cash. The Investment Manager may use derivatives (complex financial instruments) to reduce risk or to manage the Fund more efficiently.

As an additional means of assessing the performance of the Fund, the IA Technology and Technology Innovations sector average,which is based on a peer group of broadly similar funds,mayalso provide a useful comparator. Strategy The Investment Manager, within its thematic framework of environmental and social themes and positive/negative (avoidance) criteria screening, seeks to identify undervalued growth companies that are aligned with the UN’s Sustainable Development Goals, and derive at least 50% of their current or future expected revenues fromthe sustainable technology themes the Investment Manager has identified as having a positive impact on those goals. Examples of themes the InvestmentManager has identified include clean energy technology, sustainable transport, low carbon infrastructure, digital democratisation, health technology, smart cities, data security and resource and productivity optimisation. The Investment Manager looks to navigate the hype cycle (different stages in the development of a technology from conception to widespread adoption) around technology adoption by assessing the company’s fundamental business model and by focusing on companies with high quality management following good governance practices and sustainable barriers to entry, driving longer term unappreciated earnings growth. The Fund will avoid investing in companies that the Investment Manager considers could contribute to significant environmental or societal harm. Please refer to the “Investment Principles” contained on the website (www.janushenderson.com) for further information on the Fund’s sustainable investment approach.

The value of your investment may fall as a result. Smaller Companies Shares of small and mid-size companies can be more volatile than shares of larger companies, and at times it may be difficult to value or to sell shares at desired times and prices, increasing the risk of losses.

IE00BJVNH761,"Objective The Fund aims to provide a total return, based on a combination of 2.5% income and capital growth. Neither the income nor capital value atmaturity is guaranteed. The Fund is designed to be held to 18 November 2026 (Maturity) and investors should be prepared to remain invested until such date. Investment policy The Fund invests between 25% and 45% of its assets in shares (equities) of US companies and between 55% and 75% of its assets in bonds issued by US companies. The investment manager actively adjusts the allocation between equities and bonds over time based on a view of overall market risk and the valuations of bond and equity markets. At least 75% of the Fund is invested in US assets. The Fund may invest up to 25% of its assets in high yield (non-investment grade) bonds. The investment manager may use derivatives (complex financial instruments) to reduce risk, to manage the Fund more efficiently, or to generate additional capital or income for the Fund. The Fund may also invest in other assets including cash and money market instruments. The Fund is actively managed without reference to a benchmark. The investment manager has a high degree of freedom to choose individual investments for the Fund. Strategy The investment manager follows an actively-managed approach which blends mainly US equities and bonds, with the ability to position defensively when market volatility is anticipated. The Fund has the flexibility to migrate between 25% and 45% exposure to equities, depending on where the managers are finding the best individual security opportunities, as well as their assessment of broader economic conditions. The equity side of the portfolio seeks long-term growth, while the fixed income portion seeks to provide ballast as required. Distribution policy This share class accumulates income which is retained within the price of the share class. Recommendation This Fund may not be appropriate for investors who plan to withdraw their money within 5 years.

IE00BJVNH654,"Objective The Fund aims to provide a total return, based on a combination of 2.5% income and capital growth. Neither the income nor capital value atmaturity is guaranteed. The Fund is designed to be held to 18 November 2026 (Maturity) and investors should be prepared to remain invested until such date. Investment policy The Fund invests between 25% and 45% of its assets in shares (equities) of US companies and between 55% and 75% of its assets in bonds issued by US companies. The investment manager actively adjusts the allocation between equities and bonds over time based on a view of overall market risk and the valuations of bond and equity markets. At least 75% of the Fund is invested in US assets. The Fund may invest up to 25% of its assets in high yield (non-investment grade) bonds. The investment manager may use derivatives (complex financial instruments) to reduce risk, to manage the Fund more efficiently, or to generate additional capital or income for the Fund. The Fund may also invest in other assets including cash and money market instruments. The Fund is actively managed without reference to a benchmark. The investment manager has a high degree of freedom to choose individual investments for the Fund. Strategy The investment manager follows an actively-managed approach which blends mainly US equities and bonds, with the ability to position defensively when market volatility is anticipated. The Fund has the flexibility to migrate between 25% and 45% exposure to equities, depending on where the managers are finding the best individual security opportunities, as well as their assessment of broader economic conditions. The equity side of the portfolio seeks long-term growth, while the fixed income portion seeks to provide ballast as required. Distribution policy Distributions will be calculated at the discretion of the Manager with a view to providing a consistent level of distribution. Distributions include all income, and can consist of realised and unrealised capital gains, which may include of a portion of original capital invested. Charges will be deducted from capital. Distribution frequency Annual. Recommendation This Fund may not be appropriate for investors who plan to withdraw their money within 5 years. You can buy, sell or switch shares in the Fund on any business day, as defined in the Company's Prospectus.

Investment policy The Fund invests in shares and makes extensive use of derivatives (complex financial instruments) to take both ‘long’ and ‘short’ positions in companies the investment manager believes will either rise in value (long positions) or fall in value (short positions) meaning that the Fund may benefit from either scenario. The Fund will hold a significant proportion of its assets in cash and money market instruments as a result of holding derivatives and for when the investment manager wishes to take a defensive stance. Conversely, the Fund may also employ ‘leverage’ (so that the Fund can invest a greater amount than its actual value) when the investment manager has greater confidence in the opportunities available. Typically, at least 60% of the exposure to the long and short positions (in aggregate) will be to companies of any size, in any industry, in the UK. Companies may be incorporated or headquartered in the UK, deriving significant revenue from the UK, or listed on the London Stock Exchange. Up to 40% of the long and short exposure may be to non-UK companies. The Fund may also invest at the Investment Manager’s discretion in other Transferable Securities, derivative instruments and collective investment schemes. The investment manager may also use derivatives (complex financial instruments) to reduce risk or to manage the Fund more efficiently. The Fund is actively managed with reference to the Bank of England Base Rate as this forms the basis of the Fund's performance target and the level above which performance fees may be charged (if applicable). For currency hedged Share Classes, the central bank rate that corresponds withthe relevant Share Class currency is used asthe basis ofthe performance comparison and for calculating performance fees. The investment manager has complete discretion to choose investments for the Fund and is not constrained by a benchmark. Strategy The investment manager blends core long term and tactical short term ideas to construct the portfolio. Ideas come from a variety of sources including proprietary research, external research and other Janus Henderson investment teams,withthe intention oftaking long positions in companies with unexpected earnings growth or value creation potential, and short positions in companies where earnings are priced in or where long term value is impaired.

Companies will have their registered office in or do most of their business (directly or through subsidiaries) in emerging markets. 'Emerging markets' may be countries in the MSCI Emerging Markets Index, those included in theWorld Bank definition of developing (low and lowermiddle income) economies, or which are, in the investment manager’s opinion, developing. The Fund may also invest in other assets including companies outside emerging markets, cash and money market instruments. The investment manager may use derivatives (complex financial instruments) to reduce risk or to manage the Fund more efficiently. The Fund is actively managed with reference to the MSCI Emerging Markets Index, which is broadly representative of the companies in which it may invest,as this forms the basis of the Fund's performance target.The investment manager has discretion to choose investments for the Fundwithweightings different to the index or not in the index, but at times the Fund may hold investments similar to the index. Strategy The investment manager seeks consistent risk-adjusted returns by looking to identify themost attractive opportunities within countries across various stages of economic and political development. This diverse landscape requires investors to utilise an array of perspectives to fully evaluate these opportunities. By combining fundamental company research, market and economic analysis, a keen focus on governance and quantitative input, the portfolio attempts to capture price inefficiencies across companies of all sizes. Transaction costs In addition to the charges set out in the Charges section below, the Fund may incur a higher level of portfolio transaction costs as a result of investing in less actively traded markets. These costs are paid from the assets of the Fund and may have a material impact on your returns. Distribution policy This share class accumulates income which is retained within the price of the share class. Recommendation This Fund may not be appropriate for investors who plan to withdraw their money within 5 years. The Fund is designed to be used only as one component of several in a diversified investment portfolio. Investors should consider carefully the proportion of their portfolio invested into this Fund. You can buy, sell or switch shares in the Fund on any dealing day, as defined in the Company's Prospectus."

LU2543851583,"Objective The Fund aims to provide a positive (absolute) return, regardless of market conditions, over any 12 month period. A positive return is not guaranteed over this or any other time period and, particularly over the shorter term, the Fund may experience periods of negative returns. Consequently, your capital is at risk. Performance target: To outperform the Euro Main Refinancing Rate by 7% per annum, before the deduction of charges, over any 3 year period. Investment policy The Fund invests in a global portfolio of assets including shares of companies, investment grade and non-investment grade bonds issued by governments and companies (including convertible bonds, contingent convertible bonds and distressed securities), and makes extensive use of derivatives (complex financial instruments), including total return swaps, to take both ‘long’ and ‘short’ positions in companies and bonds that the investment manager believes will either rise in value (long positions) or fall in value (short positions) meaning that the Fund may benefit from either scenario. The Fund will hold a significant proportion of its assets in cash and money market instruments as a result of holding derivatives or for asset allocation purposes. The Fund may also take long or short exposures to other asset classes such as commodities and may hold other funds (such as collective investment schemes and exchange traded funds). The investment manager may also use derivatives (complex financial instruments) to reduce risk or to manage the Fund more efficiently.

The investment manager has complete discretion to choose investments for the Fund and is not constrained by a benchmark. Strategy The investment manager adopts a multi-strategy approach, utilising a diverse range of investment styles,techniques, assets, company sizes,time horizons and markets with the aim of providing a positive return. Long positions may be held through a combination of direct investment and/or derivative instruments, whilst the short positions are achieved entirely through derivative instruments.

The Fund may also take long or short exposures to other asset classes such as commodities and may hold other funds (such as collective investment schemes and exchange traded funds). The investment manager may also use derivatives (complex financial instruments) to reduce risk or to manage the Fund more efficiently. The Fund is actively managed and makes reference to the Euro Main Refinancing Rate, as this forms the basis of the Fund's performance target and the level above which performance fees may be charged (if applicable). For currency hedged share classes, the rate that corresponds with the relevant share class currency is used as the basis of the performance comparison and for calculating performance fees.The investment manager has complete discretion to choose investments for the Fund and is not constrained by a benchmark. Strategy The investmentmanager adopts amulti-strategy approach, utilising a diverse range of investment styles, techniques, assets, company sizes, time horizons and markets with the aim of providing a positive return. Long positions may be held through a combination of direct investment and/or derivative instruments, whilst the short positions are achieved entirely through derivative instruments. The use of derivatives is extensive and forms an important part of the investment strategy. Transaction costs In addition to the charges set out in the Charges section below, the Fund involves a high level of buying and selling activity and will incur higher portfolio transaction costs which are paid fromthe assets of the Fund. These may have a material impact on your returns. Distribution policy This share class accumulates income which is retained within the price of the share class.

The Fund may also invest in other assets including companies of any size, in any region, cash and money market instruments. The investment manager may use derivatives (complex financial instruments) to reduce risk or to manage the Fund more efficiently. The Fund is actively managed with reference to the MSCI Europe Small Cap Index, which is broadly representative of the companies in which it may invest, as this can provide a useful comparator for assessing the Fund's performance. The investment manager has discretion to choose investments for the Fund with weightings different to the index or not in the index, but at times the Fund may hold investments similar to the index. Strategy The investment manager focuses on meetings and calls with company management, along with the use of quantitative filters, to identify potential companies for investment. Emphasis is placed on the robustness of a company’s business model, an analysis of what drives the business, what its competitive advantage is, and the sustainability of returns. The Fund maintains a well-diversified portfolio of smaller companies but will also hold somecompanies regarded as medium sized.The liquidity of the company (the degree to which shares can be quickly bought or sold in the market at a price reflecting its intrinsic value) is important in determining whether to invest and the size of the holding for the Fund.

The Fund promotes environmental and/or social characteristics as defined underArticle8of the SustainableFinance Disclosure Regulation (SFDR). Distribution policy This share class accumulates income which is retained within the price of the share class. Recommendation This Fund may not be appropriate for investors who plan to withdraw their money within 5 years.

The investment manager has discretion to choose investments for the Fund with weightings different to the index or not in the index. Depending on prevailing market conditions the Fund’s portfolio may shift between ‘high conviction’ (whereby the manager will take significant risk relative to the index) and a more cautious stance. This means the performance of the Fund may at times differ significantly from the index, while at other times it may be more closely aligned. Strategy The investment manager looks to anticipate catalysts for change in companies and industries based on fundamental research and thought leadership, in order to construct a portfolio of large companies complemented by mid-size company opportunities with the potential to enhance the Fund's overall returns. Smaller companies are not normally a significant focus of the portfolio. Distribution policy This share class accumulates income which is retained within the price of the share class.
